# Write a function that takes a list of strings and groups anagrams together.
# Anagrams are words that have the same characters but in different orders.
#
# Example:
# ```python
# words = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
# print(group_anagrams(words))
# # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]



# lst = [10, 34, 65, 34, 56, 65, 34]
# dict = {}
# counter = 0
# for i in lst:
#     for j in range(0, len(lst)):
#         if i == lst[j]:
#             counter = counter + 1
#         dict[i] = counter
#     counter = 0
#
# print(dict)

x = 20
for day in range(1, x+1):
    print(day)
